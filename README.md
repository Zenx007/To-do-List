# 📝 Simple Task Manager in C#

This is a simple **console-based Task Manager** application written in **C#**.  
It was created as a **practice project** to strengthen my understanding of C# basics such as loops, conditionals, lists, and input/output operations.

## 🚀 Features

- Add tasks to a list
- View all current tasks
- Remove a task by its number
- Simple text-based menu for easy navigation

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as a way to:
- Practice the C# programming language
- Improve familiarity with control structures (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- Learn how to handle user input via the console
- Work with lists and basic data manipulation

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. The program continuously displays a menu until the user chooses to exit.
2. Users can add new tasks, see all tasks, or remove any task by entering its number.
